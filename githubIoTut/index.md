# This is a large header

## This is a slightly smaller header

This could be the body of this subsection that I'm taking about here.

### This is a sub-subsection header

This is a way to make an un-ordered list:
 * first bullet point
 * second bullet point
 * third bullet point
 
This is an ordered list:
 1. first item in ordered list
 1. this is yet another item
 1. this is another item

So now, I will add in a figure.

Adding in another photo:

Wrong code:
```![another photo alt text](https://github.com/jnaiman/jnaiman.github.io/blob/master/savedphotogithub.png)```

If in main directory
```![another photo alt text](https://github.com/jnaiman/jnaiman.github.io/blob/master/savedphotogithub.png?raw=true)```

Now that things are in this `githubIoTut` subdirectory:

#### Last thing

Adding in a link: [this is a link to the AOG section of IS445](https://uiuc-ischool-dataviz.github.io/is445AOG_fall2020/)

I can also link to [google](https://www.google.com/)
